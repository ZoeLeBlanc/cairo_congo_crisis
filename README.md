# Code for Cairo's Congo Crisis

This repository contains the code scripts and notebooks for my work in progress paper "Cairoâ€™s Congo Crisis: Exploring The Arab Observer and Anti-Colonialism in the United Arab Republic Through Computational Methods". The paper isn't yet available publicly, but I'm happy to share it upon request.

The paper explores the history of Egypt's involvement in the Congo crisis from 1960-1966 using a combination of diplomatic cables, memoirs, and Egyptian press materials. Focusing particular on one magazine, the Arab Observer, this paper uses computational methods to trace the broader discursive shifts in Cairo as the Congo crisis transformed from a struggle over the independence of Congo towards a larger litmus test for both the Cold War and Third World.
